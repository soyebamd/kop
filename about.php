        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Good times, great food, and delicious drinks have always been the motto of a group of Drexel OX fraternity brothers and friends. Like many restauranteurs, the love of hospitality and entertaining friends is the backbone of the KOP Grill & Tavern in King of Prussia. In addition to warm hospitality, we love to play and compete with each other, and we've amassed a full arsenal of games that include pool tables, a 16' shuffleboard table, dart boards, arcade games, and PA skills games. Our game room provides hours of fun and enjoyment. In addition, we have partnered with Riverchasers to host poker tournaments and the local PA American Pool Association to host pool tournaments. In addition to our gaming area, our bar is adorned with an array of flatscreen TVs to catch all the local sporting events.</p>
        <p>The KOP Grill & Tavern menu created by executive Chef Daniel Waller and General Manager Jim Halley presents innovative comfort food thatâ€™s complimented by an exciting lineup of craft cocktails and beers. We literally offer something for everyone, kids included! We're open seven days a week from 11 am to midnight. Saturday and Sunday join us for an incredible brunch from 9 am to 2 pm.</p>
